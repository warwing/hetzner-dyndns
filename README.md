# hetzner-dyndns
A small python script that accesses the Hetzner API to update DNS records

## General
I know that this script is kind of overkill for this simple task, but it was a fun learning experience for me...
- Using config files
- Sending mails from a Python script
- Implementing a logger in Python

## Usage
**Configuration**
Create a configuration file where you want and give it a fitting name. It doesn't have to be named `conf.json` that's just my preference. You can specify a config file name when executing the script.

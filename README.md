# hetzner-dyndns
A small python script that accesses the Hetzner API to update DNS records

## General
I know that this script is kind of overkill for this simple task, as well as by all this functionality it could offer a way more flexible configuration for example.
But since this was just a fun experience for me messing around with Python functions and stuff, I didn't bother to put too much effort into creating a "professional script". 

## Usage
Clone the repository into your desired location then create a customized configuration in your desired location. It doesn't have to be named `conf.json`, that's just my preference. You can specify a config file name when executing the script.
